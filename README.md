# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Getting Started

```sh
# if using yarn v7 add --legacy-peer-deps option
# see details here: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/12983
yarn install
```

Copy the .env file to a new .env.local file, and add your OpenAI API key.

Now execute the following commands to run the app:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Now point your browser to http://localhost:5173/.
